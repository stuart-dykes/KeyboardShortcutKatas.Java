# KeyboardShortcutKatas.Java
Katas to learn keyboarding skills. Don't forget to run the unit tests when you are editing code. Suggest looking at the exercises in this order:

* [Move Line](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/MoveLine.md) 
* [Navigation](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/Navigation.java)
* [Inline](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/Inline.java)
* [Multi Cursor](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/MultiCursor.md)
* [Expand Selection](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/ExpandSelection.md)
* [Duplicate Lines](src/main/java/keyboardshortcutkatas/DuplicateLines.md)

## Acknowledgements
These exercises were initially invented by [LearnWithLlew](https://github.com/LearnWithLlew/KeyboardShortcutKatas.Net) and I added a few more.
