# Multiple Carets
All these exercises need multiple carets or cursors. Take a moment to look up the documentation for your editor and look up the keyboard shortcuts you need. If your editor doesn't have support for all these features, switch to another for this exercise.

## Column Select 

### Adding 

Create several cursors in a column. Transform the start: `1 => * 1)` so the markdown shows a bulleted list

1 apple
2 orange
3 pear
4 kiwi
5 mango
6 grape
7 dragonfruit

### Deleting

Create several cursors in a column. Delete the j and the two characters that follow

1 apjefple
2 orj*!ange
3 pej&Var
4 kijQtwi
5 majp@ngo
6 grj%9ape
7 drjlKagonfruit

## Word Select 
Create a cursor at the start of each word, then select the whole word. Note you can copy/paste columns of words. 

Transform `1 apple => private string apple = "apple";`

1 apple
2 orange
3 pear
4 kiwi
5 mango
6 grape
7 dragonfruit

## Select Next

Create an additional cursor at the start of the next matching word.

Transform: 
`Lynx => Shark`
`Dee => Doo`

Baby Lynx
Dee dee, dee dee dee dee
Baby Lynx
Dee dee, dee dee dee dee
Baby Lynx
Dee dee, dee dee dee doo
Baby Lynx

## Parrot
In ParrotTest.cs create additional cursors at the beginning of the expression `new Parrot(` and relace it with `Parrot.createParrot(`

Make sure the tests still pass.
